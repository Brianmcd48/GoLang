# GoLang
This Git will serve as my record of progress in Learning Go. My main source for this journey will be "The Go Programming Langauge" by Alan A. A. Donovan and Brian W. Kernighan.

# Chapter 1: Introduction
I have just uploaded my first program the traditional Hello World, The main idea of this first program is to educate the user on packages and how to import and utilize them as well as basic syntax. 

# Chapter 1.2: Reading command line arguments
The second function showcases comments and how to read in command line arguments using go. This is then utilized to build our own version of the echo commmand. Additionally echo2 and echo3 show the same functionality from different timed approachs to compare performance.
